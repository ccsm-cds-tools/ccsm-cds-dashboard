Uterus.  Specimen A is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, medical record number, “uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes, right ovary, right ovarian mass” and consists of a tan uterus (10.0 x 7.0 x 4.8 cm, 141 g), and detached 2 unoriented purple tan fallopian tubes (7.2 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm, 7.7 x 3.0 x 1.7 cm).  The serosal surface of the uterus is tan-brown and smooth.  The ectocervix (2.7 x 2.2 cm) is light tan with an eccentrically placed slit like os (1.1 cm in diameter).  The uterus is bivalved to reveal an endocervical canal (3.7 cm in length) which is dilated with multiple smooth-walled cysts filled with gelatinous material ranging from 0.2-0.9 cm.  The endometrial cavity (6.2 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm) is scantly hemorrhagic with a pedunculated polyp (1.5 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm) identified on the anterior lower uterine segment. The fallopian tubes are serially sectioned to reveal tan lumens. Additionally in the container is an intact ovary with cyst (3.5 x 2.3 x 1.8 cm) and a possible ovarian fragment (4.3 x 2.1 x 1.1 cm).  The intact ovary is serially sectioned to reveal tan yellow cut surfaces, hair, and hemorrhagic area. The possible ovarian fragment is serially sectioned to reveal tan-brown cut surfaces.  Separately in the container is a previously opened mass (14.0 x 9.5 x 7.2 cm) with an incision of 7.3 cm with hair and caseous material.  The mass is serially sectioned to reveal tan-yellow cut surfaces, caseous material, and hair and an area of focal hemorrhage (4.5 x 2.3 cm).  Representative sections are submitted in A1-A16.
